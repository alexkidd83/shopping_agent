"""
The `tools` package exposes interfaces to external services required by
the shopping agent.  Each module should provide functions that
encapsulate the details of HTTP requests, data parsing and error
handling.

Stubs in this directory return mocked data to facilitate development
without hitting real APIs.  Replace the stubbed implementations with
actual API calls when integrating with Amazon, Idealo and eBay.
